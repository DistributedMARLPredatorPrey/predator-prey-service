Welcome to Predator Prey App's documentation!
=============================================

**Predator Prey App** is a Python application which simulates a Predator Prey environment.

It could either be run in 'simulation' mode, where the environment is simulated using an existing policy,
or in 'learning' mode, where the policy changes over time and gets synchronized from an external service.

It provides a *simple* and *intuitive* API to get the environment current state, including the agents' position.
